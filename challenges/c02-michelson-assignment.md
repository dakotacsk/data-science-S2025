# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)

url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1av_SXn4j0-4Rk0mQFik3LLr-uf0YdA06i3ugE6n-Zdo/edit?usp=sharing"

# Parameters
LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM    <- 299792.458 # Exact speed of light in a vacuum (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON <- 299944.00  # Michelson's speed estimate (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_PM        <- 51         # Michelson error estimate (km / s)
```

*Background*: In 1879 Albert Michelson led an experimental campaign to
measure the speed of light. His approach was a development upon the
method of Foucault\[3\], and resulted in a new estimate of
$v_0 = 299944 \pm 51$ kilometers per second (in a vacuum). This is very
close to the modern *exact* value of 2.9979246^{5}. In this challenge,
you will analyze Michelson’s original data, and explore some of the
factors associated with his experiment.

I’ve already copied Michelson’s data from his 1880 publication; the code
chunk below will load these data from a public googlesheet.

*Aside*: The speed of light is *exact* (there is **zero error** in the
value `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`) because the meter is actually
[*defined*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Speed_of_light_definition)
in terms of the speed of light!

- `Date`: Date of measurement
- `Distinctness`: Distinctness of measured images: 3 = good, 2 = fair, 1
  = poor
- `Temp`: Ambient temperature (Fahrenheit)
- `Velocity`: Measured speed of light (km / s)

### **q1** Re-create the following table (from Michelson (1880), pg. 139) using `df_michelson` and `dplyr`. Note that your values *will not* match those of Michelson *exactly*; why might this be?

| Distinctness | n   | MeanVelocity |
|--------------|-----|--------------|
| 3            | 46  | 299860       |
| 2            | 39  | 299860       |
| 1            | 15  | 299810       |

``` r
## TODO: Compute summaries
df_q1 <- df_michelson %>%
  group_by(Distinctness) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    MeanVelocity = mean(Velocity)
  )

df_q1 %>%
  arrange(desc(Distinctness)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Distinctness |   n | MeanVelocity |
|:-------------|----:|-------------:|
| 3            |  46 |     299861.7 |
| 2            |  39 |     299858.5 |
| 1            |  15 |     299808.0 |

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here!
  - Category 3 in distinctness has more recorded values than 2 and both
    have more than 1. It also seems that distinctness describes three
    case scenarios. Potentially with 3 and 2 being more similar to each
    other, and 1 less similar. This is deduced because the values
    recorded in distinctness 2 and 3 are closer in value.
- Why might your table differ from Michelson’s?
  - We might be missing a few values, or Michelson might have done some
    rounding work or removing of errors in his published work.

The `Velocity` values in the dataset are the speed of light *in air*;
Michelson introduced a couple of adjustments to estimate the speed of
light in a vacuum. In total, he added $+92$ km/s to his mean estimate
for `VelocityVacuum` (from Michelson (1880), pg. 141). While the
following isn’t fully rigorous ($+92$ km/s is based on the mean
temperature), we’ll simply apply this correction to all the observations
in the dataset.

### **q2** Create a new variable `VelocityVacuum` with the $+92$ km/s adjustment to `Velocity`. Assign this new dataframe to `df_q2`.

``` r
## TODO: Adjust the data, assign to df_q2
df_q2 <- df_michelson %>%
  mutate(VelocityVacuum = Velocity + 92)

df_q2

As part of his study, Michelson assessed the various potential sources
of error, and provided his best-guess for the error in his
speed-of-light estimate. These values are provided in
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`—his nominal estimate—and
`LIGHTSPEED_PM`—plus/minus bounds on his estimate. Put differently,
Michelson believed the true value of the speed-of-light probably lay
between `LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM` and
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON + LIGHTSPEED_PM`.

Let’s introduce some terminology:\[2\]

- **Error** is the difference between a true value and an estimate of
  that value; for instance `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`.
- **Uncertainty** is an analyst’s *assessment* of the error.

Since a “true” value is often not known in practice, one generally does
not know the error. The best they can do is quantify their degree of
uncertainty. We will learn some means of quantifying uncertainty in this
class, but for many real problems uncertainty includes some amount of
human judgment.\[2\]

### **q3** Compare Michelson’s speed of light estimate against the modern speed of light value. Is Michelson’s estimate of the error (his uncertainty) greater or less than the true error?

``` r
## TODO: Compare Michelson's estimate and error against the true value
## Your code here!

true_error <- LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON
michelson_uncertainty <- LIGHTSPEED_PM

true_error
```

    ## [1] -151.542

``` r
michelson_uncertainty
```

    ## [1] 51

**Observations**:

- Is Michelson’s estimate of the error (his uncertainty) greater or less
  than the true error?
  - Michelson’s estimate of the error is was *smaller* than true error.
- Make a quantitative comparison between Michelson’s uncertainty and his
  error.
  - Michelson’s estimate of the speed of light (299944.00 km/s) was
    151.542 km/s higher than the modern value (299792.458 km/s). His
    reported uncertainty (±51 km/s) was smaller than the true error. His
    uncertainty range did not include the true value. This means there
    might be additional unaccounted errors in his experiment.

The following plot shows all of Michelson’s data as a [control
chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart); this sort of plot
is common in manufacturing, where it is used to help determine if a
manufacturing process is under [statistical
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control).
Each dot is one of Michelson’s measurements, and the grey line connects
the mean taken for each day. The same plot also shows simulated data
using a probability model. We’ll get into statistics later in the
course; for now, let’s focus on understanding what real and simulated
data tend to look like.

### **q4** Inspect the following plot with the `Real` Michelson data and `Simulated` data from a probability model. Document the similarities and differences between the data under *observe* below.

``` r
## Note: No need to edit this chunk!
## Calibrate simulated data
v_mean <-
  df_q2 %>%
  summarize(m = mean(VelocityVacuum)) %>%
  pull(m)

  pull(s)

    values_to = "velocity"
  ) %>%

    yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON,

    yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM,
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_hline(

    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +

  geom_line(
    data = . %>%
      group_by(Date, source) %>%
      summarize(velocity_mean = mean(velocity)),
    mapping = aes(y = velocity_mean),
    color = "grey50"
  ) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(y = velocity),
    size = 0.8
  ) +

  facet_grid(source~.) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Date of Measurement (1879)",
    y = "Velocity (in Vacuum)"
  )
```

**Observations**:

Similarities

- Both had fluctuations over time
- The general pattern of variation are somewhat similar
- Both real and simulated data sets contain numerous individual
  measurements (black dots) scattered around the trend lines

Differences

- The real data appears to be “sharper” and have more pronounced
  fluctuations compared to simulated data, which seems smoother
- The simulated data seems to be “smoother” and have less variation and
  extreme values

### **q5** You have access to a few other variables. Construct a **at least three** visualizations of `VelocityVacuum` against these other factors. Are there other patterns in the data that might help explain the difference between Michelson’s estimate and `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`?

**Observations**:

Based on the graphs, we can assume that date has minimal effect on the
speed of light, whereas temperature and distinctness seem to have some
form of correlation. While the statistical analysis shows that it is not
enough to confirm a correlation, we are able to see from the
distribution of error graphs that this might be a multimodal
distribution. This alludes to a few variables being the driving factor
of errors. We also see that his measurements skew right from the
official accepted speed of light, so we can safely assume that the
driving factors make the light of speed faster rather than slower. More
analysis will have to be done on the remaining original dataset to draw
meaningful conclusions.
