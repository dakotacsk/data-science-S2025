*Purpose*: Confidence and prediction intervals are useful for studying
“pure sampling” of some distribution. However, we can combine CI and PI
with regression analysis to equip our modeling efforts with powerful
notions of uncertainty. In this challenge, you will use fluid simulation
data in a regression analysis with uncertainty quantification (CI and
PI) to support engineering design.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

# Orientation: Exploring Simulation Results

*Background*: The data you will study in this exercise come from a
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [simulation
campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932219308651?via%3Dihub)
that studied the interaction of turbulent flow and radiative heat
transfer to fluid-suspended particles\[1\]. These simulations were
carried out to help study a novel design of [solar
receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power),
though they are more aimed at fundamental physics than detailed device
design. The following code chunk downloads and unpacks the data to your
local `./data/` folder.

![PSAAP II irradiated core flow](./images/psaap-setup.png) Figure 1. An
example simulation, frozen at a specific point in time. An initial
simulation is run (HIT SECTION) to generate a turbulent flow with
particles, and that swirling flow is released into a rectangular domain
(RADIATED SECTION) with bulk downstream flow (left to right).
Concentrated solar radiation transmits through the optically transparent
fluid, but deposits heat into the particles. The particles then convect
heat into the fluid, which heats up the flow. The false-color image
shows the fluid temperature: Notice that there are “hot spots” where hot
particles have deposited heat into the fluid. The dataset `df_psaap`
gives measurements of `T_norm = (T - T0) / T0` averaged across planes at
various locations along the RADIATED SECTION.

**Observations**:

- There are 22 columns in df_psaap, and 140 rows. All of the columns are
  numeric and stored in doubles. The dataset does not contain any
  missing values.

The important variables in this dataset are:

| Variable | Category | Meaning                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x`      | Spatial  | Channel location                  |
| `idx`    | Metadata | Simulation run                    |
| `L`      | Input    | Channel length                    |
| `W`      | Input    | Channel width                     |
| `U_0`    | Input    | Bulk velocity                     |
| `N_p`    | Input    | Number of particles               |
| `k_f`    | Input    | Turbulence level                  |
| `T_f`    | Input    | Fluid inlet temp                  |
| `rho_f`  | Input    | Fluid density                     |
| `mu_f`   | Input    | Fluid viscosity                   |
| `lam_f`  | Input    | Fluid conductivity                |
| `C_fp`   | Input    | Fluid isobaric heat capacity      |
| `rho_p`  | Input    | Particle density                  |
| `d_p`    | Input    | Particle diameter                 |
| `C_pv`   | Input    | Particle isochoric heat capacity  |
| `h`      | Input    | Convection coefficient            |
| `I_0`    | Input    | Radiation intensity               |
| `eps_p`  | Input    | Radiation absorption coefficient  |
| `avg_q`  | Output   | Plane-averaged heat flux          |
| `avg_T`  | Output   | Plane-averaged fluid temperature  |
| `rms_T`  | Output   | Plane-rms fluid temperature       |
| `T_norm` | Output   | Normalized fluid temperature rise |

The primary output of interest is `T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f`, the
normalized (dimensionless) temperature rise of the fluid, due to heat
transfer. These measurements are taken at locations `x` along a column
of fluid, for different experimental settings (e.g. different dimensions
`W, L`, different flow speeds `U_0`, etc.).

### **q2** Visualize `T_norm` against `x`. Note that there are multiple simulations at different values of the Input variables: Each simulation result is identified by a different value of `idx`.

``` r
## TODO: Visualize the data in df_psaap with T_norm against x;
##       design your visual to handle the multiple simulations,
##       each identified by different values of idx

df_psaap %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = T_norm, group = idx)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.3) +
  ggtitle("T_norm vs Channel Location, grouped by Simulation Run (idx)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Modeling

The following chunk will split the data into training and validation
sets.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
# Addl' Note: These data are already randomized by idx; no need
# to additionally shuffle the data!
df_train <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 1:20)
df_validate <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 21:36)
```

One of the key decisions we must make in modeling is choosing predictors
(features) from our observations to include in the model. Ideally we
should have some intuition for why these predictors are reasonable to
include in the model; for instance, we saw above that location along the
flow `x` tends to affect the temperature rise `T_norm`. This is because
fluid downstream has been exposed to solar radiation for longer, and
thus is likely to be at a higher temperature.

Reasoning about our variables—at least at a *high level*—can help us to
avoid including *fallacious* predictors in our models. You’ll explore
this idea in the next task.

### **q3** The following code chunk fits a few different models. Compute a measure of model accuracy for each model on `df_validate`, and compare their performance.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit these models
fit_baseline <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_cheat <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ avg_T)

fit_nonphysical <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ idx)

## TODO: Compute a measure of accuracy for each fit above;
##       compare their relative performance
mse(fit_baseline, df_psaap)
```

    ## [1] 0.121274

``` r
mse(fit_cheat, df_psaap)
```

    ## [1] 0.05270426

``` r
mse(fit_nonphysical, df_psaap)
```

    ## [1] 0.2008767

**Observations**:

- Which model is *most accurate*? Which is *least accurate*?
  - `fit_cheat` is the most accurate; `fit_nonphysical` is the least
    accurate.
- What *Category* of variable is `avg_T`? Why is it such an effective
  predictor?
  - `avg_T` is the Plane-averaged fluid temperature, which is an
    *Output* variable. It is effective because it is directly related to
    the output `T_norm`.
- Would we have access to `avg_T` if we were trying to predict a *new*
  value of `T_norm`? Is `avg_T` a valid predictor?
  - No. We calculate avg_T based on the output `T_norm`, so we would not
    have access to it before we guessed what `T_norm` should be. It is
    not a valid predictor.
- What *Category* of variable is `idx`? Does it have any physical
  meaning?
  - `idx` is the id of the row number. It is a metadata variable and
    does not have any physical meaning.

### **q4** Interpret this model

Interpret the following model by answering the questions below.

*Note*. The `-` syntax in R formulas allows us to exclude columns from
fitting. So `T_norm ~ . - x` would fit on all columns *except* `x`.

``` r
## TODO: Inspect the regression coefficients for the following model
fit_q4 <-
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ . - idx - avg_q - avg_T - rms_T)

fit_q4 %>% tidy()

**Observations**:

- Which columns are excluded in the model formula above? What categories
  do these belong to? Why are these important quantities to leave out of
  the model?
  - `idx`, `avg_q`, `avg_T`, and `rms_T` are excluded. `idx` is a
    metadata variable, while `avg_q`, `avg_T`, and `rms_T` are outputs.
    These are important to leave out of the model because metadata does
    not have a physical meaning and the outputs are not available before
    we make the prediction.
- Which inputs are *statistically significant*, according to the model?
  - According to the p-values (assuming p\<0.05 is significant), `x`,
    `L`, `W`, `U_0`, `C_fp`, `d_p` and `I_0` are all statistically
    significant.
- What is the regression coefficient for `x`? What about the regression
  coefficient for `T_f`?
  - The regression coefficient for `x` is 1.018323e+00. The regression
    coefficient for `T_f` is -3.791436e-04 .
- What is the standard deviation of `x` in `df_psaap`? What about the
  standard deviation of `T_f`?
  - The standard deviation of `x` is 0.2805121 and the standard
    deviation of `T_f` is 38.94204.
- How do these standard deviations relate to the regression coefficients
  for `x` and `T_f`?
  - `x` has a large coefficient (1.02), but it has a small standard
    deviation (0.28). `T_f` has a tiny coefficient (-0.00038) and a
    large SD (38.94). This means that while `x` has a seemingly larger
    impact, due to the small std, it only causes a change of ~0.286
    units per one std unit change. `T_f` has a small impact, and even
    with the large std it barely has a real world effect.
- Note that literally *all* of the inputs above have *some* effect on
  the output `T_norm`; so they are all “significant” in that sense. What
  does this tell us about the limitations of statistical significance
  for interpreting regression coefficients?
  - Just because something is statistically significant doesn’t mean it
    has a meaningful or practical effect. With enough data, even tiny,
    irrelevant effects can show up as “significant.” It’s more useful to
    consider effect size in context—like how a coefficient actually
    translates to changes in the output given the input’s variability.
    This is also a good time to think about causation vs correlation.
    Just because two variables are correlated doesn’t mean one causes
    the other.

## Contrasting CI and PI

Let’s revisit the ideas of confidence intervals (CI) and prediction
intervals (PI). Let’s fit a very simple model to these data, one which
only considers the channel location and ignores all other inputs. We’ll
also use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` (defined in the
`setup` chunk above) to add approximate CI and PI to the linear model.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
fit_simple <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(data = ., formula = T_norm ~ x)

df_intervals <-
  df_train %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "confidence", prefix = "ci") %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi")
```

The following figure visualizes the regression CI and PI against the
objects they are attempting to capture:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
df_intervals %>%
  select(T_norm, x, matches("ci|pi")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c("method", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = matches("ci|pi")
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, fit)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, color = method),
    width = 0.05,
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_psaap %>% mutate(method = "ci"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    se = FALSE,
    linetype = 2,
    color = "black"
   ) +
  geom_point(
    data = df_validate %>% mutate(method = "pi"),

  ) +

  facet_grid(~method) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Channel Location (-)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (-)"
  )

Under the `ci` facet we have the regression confidence intervals and the
mean trend (computed with all the data `df_psaap`). Under the `pi` facet
we have the regression prediction intervals and the `df_validation`
observations.

**Punchline**:

- Confidence intervals are meant to capture the *mean trend*
- Prediction intervals are meant to capture *new observations*

Both CI and PI are a quantification of the uncertainty in our model, but
the two intervals designed to answer different questions.

Since CI and PI are a quantification of uncertainty, they should tend to
*narrow* as our model becomes more confident in its predictions.
Building a more accurate model will often lead to a reduction in
uncertainty. We’ll see this phenomenon in action with the following
task:

### **q5** The following code will construct a predicted-vs-actual plot with your model from *q4* and add prediction intervals. Study the results and answer the questions below under *observations*.

``` r
## TODO: Run this code and interpret the results
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
## NOTE: This chunk will use your model from q4; it will predict on the
##       validation data, add prediction intervals for every prediction,
##       and visualize the results on a predicted-vs-actual plot. It will
##       also compare against the simple `fit_simple` defined above.

**Observations**:

- Which model tends to be more accurate? How can you tell from this
  predicted-vs-actual plot?
  - q4 is more accurate. If we look at the graph, we can see that model
    q4’s predictions are much closer to the actual T_norm compared to
    model x’s predictions. We also see that there seems to only four
    main values that model x predicts, with it capping at 1 while T_norm
    actual increases.
- Which model tends to be *more confident* in its predictions? Put
  differently, which model has *narrower prediction intervals*?
  - q4 model is much more confident.
- How many predictors does the `fit_simple` model need in order to make
  a prediction? What about your model `fit_q4`?
  - `fit_simple` only uses 1 prediction, `x`, whereas `fit_q4` uses
    every predictor but `idx`, `avg_q`, `avg_T`, and `rms_T`. This means
    fit_q4 uses 17 predictors.

Based on these results, you might be tempted to always throw every
reasonable variable into the model. For some cases, that might be the
best choice. However, some variables might be *outside our control*; for
example, variables involving human behavior cannot be fully under our
control. Other variables may be *too difficult to measure*; for example,
it is *in theory* possible to predict the strength of a component by
having detailed knowledge of its microstructure. However, it is
*patently infeasible* to do a detailed study of *every single component*
that gets used in an airplane.

In both cases—human behavior and variable material properties—we would
be better off treating those quantities as random variables. There are
at least two ways we could treat these factors: 1. Explicitly model some
inputs as random variables and construct a model that *propagates* that
uncertainty from inputs to outputs, or 2. Implicitly model the
uncontrolled the uncontrolled variables by not including them as
predictors in the model, and instead relying on the error term
$\epsilon$ to represent these unaccounted factors. You will pursue
strategy 2. in the following Case Study.

# Case Study: Predicting Performance Ranges

### **q6** You are consulting with a team that is designing a prototype heat transfer device. They are asking you to help determine a *dependable range of values* for `T_norm` they can design around for this *single prototype*. The realized value of `T_norm` must not be too high as it may damage the downstream equipment, but it must also be high enough to extract an acceptable amount of heat.

In order to maximize the conditions under which this device can operate
successfully, the design team has chosen to fix the variables listed in
the table below, and consider the other variables to fluctuate according
to the values observed in `df_psaap`.

| Variable | Value    |
|----------|----------|
| `x`      | 1.0      |
| `L`      | 0.2      |
| `W`      | 0.04     |
| `U_0`    | 1.0      |
| (Other)  | (Varies) |

Your task is to use a regression analysis to deliver to the design team
a *dependable range* of values for `T_norm`, given their proposed
design, and at a fairly high level `0.8`. Perform your analysis below
(use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` with the `level`
argument!), and answer the questions below.

*Hint*: This problem will require you to *build a model* by choosing the
appropriate variables to include in the analysis. Think about *which
variables the design team can control*, and *which variables they have
chosen to allow to vary*. You will also need to choose between computing
a CI or PI for the design prediction.

``` r
# NOTE: No need to change df_design; this is the target the client
#       is considering
df_design <- tibble(x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0)
# NOTE: This is the level the "probability" level customer wants
pr_level <- 0.8

## TODO: Fit a model, assess the uncertainty in your prediction, 
#        use the validation data to check your uncertainty estimates, and 
#        make a recommendation on a *dependable range* of values for T_norm
#        at the point `df_design`
fit_q6 <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x + L + W + U_0)

df_prediction <-
  df_design %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_q6, interval = "prediction", level = pr_level)

df_prediction
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 7
    ##       x     L     W   U_0 pred_fit pred_lwr pred_upr
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1     1   0.2  0.04     1     1.88     1.46     2.30

``` r
df_validate_pi <- df_validate %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_q6, interval = "prediction", level = pr_level, prefix = "pi")

coverage <- df_validate_pi %>%
  mutate(in_interval = T_norm >= pi_lwr & T_norm <= pi_upr) %>%
  summarize(coverage = mean(in_interval))

coverage
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   coverage
    ##      <dbl>
    ## 1    0.933

**Recommendation**:

- How much do you trust your model? Why?
  - I trust it moderately. It is a simple model that only uses 4
    predictors, and it is based on the training data. However, I am not
    sure how well it will generalize to new data.
- What kind of interval—confidence or prediction—would you use for this
  task, and why?
  - I would use the prediction interval because the team is trying to
    predict the range of actual T_norm outcomes in the real world, not
    just the mean trend. By using the prediction interval we can account
    for real-world randomness.
- What fraction of validation cases lie within the intervals you
  predict? (NB. Make sure to calculate your intervals *based on the
  validation data*; don’t just use one single interval!) How does this
  compare with `pr_level`?
  - About 93.3% of validation cases fall within the predicted 80%
    prediction interval. This means the interval is conservative (a bit
    wider than necessary) but that’s not a bad thing for engineering
    design where safety margins are valuable.
- What interval for `T_norm` would you recommend the design team to plan
  around?
  - I would recommend they plan around a T_norm range of \[1.457,
    2.296\], which gives them a reliable performance band based on
    current design settings and typical variability in the other
    factors.
- Are there any other recommendations you would provide?
  - Yes. I would recommend that the design team consider the impact of
    the other impactful variables (e.g. I_0, d_p, or h). Something like
    a sensitivity analysis could help figure out which one is the most
    important one to focus on.

*Bonus*: One way you could take this analysis further is to recommend
which other variables the design team should tightly control. You could
do this by fixing values in `df_design` and adding them to the model. An
exercise you could carry out would be to systematically test the
variables to see which ones the design team should more tightly control.
